Shbot is an IRC bot that runs shell code. It is a fork of a fork of evalbot
(http://www.vidarholen.net/contents/evalbot/).

To run shbot, you need an initramfs image and a kernel, which you can find here:
https://github.com/geirha/shbot-initramfs/releases

Save the files as `shbot.cpio.gz` and `shbot-kernel`, then run `make`

# TLDR:

Make sure you have qemu installed and nodejs

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/matheusfillipeag/shbot.git 
cd shbot
wget https://github.com/geirha/shbot-initramfs/releases/download/v0.1/shbot-0.1.cpio.gz -o shbot.cpio.gz
wget https://github.com/geirha/shbot-initramfs/releases/download/v0.1/shbot-kernel-4.7.2 -o shbot-kernel
make  # this will create the hda
npm install  # use node 10.30.0 or older to install, you can run this with later versions then
node index.js
```
